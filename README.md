Predicting Default Risk

What decisions need to be made?
I am a data scientist working for a small bank. This week the number of loan applications increased by 150% from 200/week to 500/week.

The manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants me to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week.

I'll use Python libraries to process the loan applications.

I will classify the loan applications as “Creditworthy” or “Not-Creditworthy” using Random Forest.
